## Comprehensive Application Feature Plan and Wish List

### I. Core Functionality & Data Structure Improvements

* **Sample Tracking Differentiation (Hierarchical Data):**
    * Implement a complex hierarchical data structure for samples: **Manufacturer** → **Sub-Company** → **Line** → **Color**.
    * Differentiate between a **Single Sample/Tile** and a **Board** (which may contain multiple tiles/colors).
    * **Sample Edit Window Enhancement:** Add the ability to configure **Size** options (tile size, plank length, etc.) within the sample edit window.
* **Job Management Ambiguity Resolution:**
    * Develop a mechanism (e.g., a field or flag) to link multiple estimates for the same customer, asking: "Is this job part of another job situation?"
* **Notes Section Relocation:**
    * Move the **Notes section** out of the "Job Details" area and into its own dedicated, accessible modal window. This allows notes to be recorded for the project before a quote is created or accepted.

### II. Image Management & Branding

* **Advanced Image Management:**
    * Allow **multiple photos per sample** (e.g., manufacturer's photo and a showroom/real-world photo).
    * Allow the user to choose a **primary photo** for default display.
    * Allow the PDF export feature to utilize **multiple photos** for a single product/material.
* **File Naming (Development Cleanup):**
    * Investigate making uploaded image file names more **descriptive** than a random string of numbers.
* **User Interface and Branding:**
    * Add the ability to customize the UI colors (for branding).
    * Implement a logo to be used in various places (e.g., in the app, in emails).
    * Declare a **favicon** to resolve the current error.

### III. PDF Export & Reporting

* **Customer Presentation/PDF Export:**
    * Develop a feature to **export customer presentations to PDF**.
    * The presentation should be based on a UI design and show what services/materials are being used in specific rooms.
    * Add new database fields to support presentations:
        * **Room Type**
        * **Grout Selection**
        * **Size** (for tracking selected dimensions for the presentation)
* **QR Code Export:**
    * Add an option on the sample check out screen to **export the sample's QR code as a PDF** and enable direct **printing** of the code.
* **Dashboard/Reporting:**
    * Create a **daily project update dashboard or report** to show:
        * Samples that need to be returned.
        * Samples that are currently checked out.
        * Jobs that are upcoming or in progress.
        * Consider adding a **top sample checkout list**.

### IV. UI/UX and Validation Enhancements

* **Vendor Directory Enhancements:**
    * Add a **full-width search bar** to the Vendor Directory dashboard (to align with Customer and Sample dashboards).
    * Develop a **Vendor details page** accessible from the directory to view all associated samples and vendor information.
* **Dashboard Enhancements:**
    * Add a **Return button** for samples on the main dashboard for quick action.
    * Implement **colored bell icon alerts** for "Awaiting Decision" jobs to indicate follow-up urgency.
    * Add a button/status to move "Awaiting Decision" jobs to a non-active status, such as "**Customer Not Interested**."
* **Input Field/Form Logic:**
    * Implement **email and phone validation** for all customer and installer entry points.
    * Ensure that a partially-typed **Customer Name** transfers to the "Create New Customer" dialogue.
    * Ensure that a partially-typed **Vendor Name** transfers to the "Create New Vendor" dialogue.
    * The **Manufacturer input field** on the 'New Sample' creation screen must be an **on-the-fly search and edit field** with validation, preventing the creation of blank entries.
* **Customer Dashboard Redesign:**
    * Replace the simple list of customers with a **Customer Dashboard** featuring multiple sections:
        * A short list (max 3 with a "See More") of customers with **samples checked out**.
        * A short list (max 3 with a "See More") of customers with **active jobs**.
    * Customer cards must display an indicator showing if the customer has **something checked out** and/or an **active job**.
* **Vendor/Checkout Integration:**
    * Allow **vendors** to show up in the customer area of the checkout section so they can check out samples for one of their customers.

### V. Email Functionality

* **Email System Configuration:**
    * Implement an email configuration in the settings to allow for using different SMTP services.
    * Configure emails to be sent using Gmail's SMTP service.
    * Ensure a copy of sent messages is logged in your company's Gmail account (to maintain communication history).
    * Design a graphical email template using CSS for the sent messages.

### VI. Bug Fixes & Technical Debt

* **Job Visibility Bug:**
    * Investigate and fix the bug where a job scheduled for next January is **not appearing** on the dashboard.
    * Address the underlying cause, specifically the handling of **single-day jobs** where start and end dates are the same.
* **Countertop Install Logic:**
    * Develop a subroutine to accommodate countertop installations which require two distinct single-day appointments (**template appointment** and **install appointment**).
* **Installer Page Display Bug:**
    * Investigate and correct the display issue on the installer page under "Assigned Projects" where the balance due is currently showing as `$$0` (two dollar signs and potentially incorrect formatting/labeling).

### VII. Security & Future Planning

* **Security Audit:**
    * Perform a **safety audit** by feeding the code file-by-file into a new chat window with Gemini to evaluate security concerns and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Future Development/Benchmarking:**
    * Look into other existing software packages that track sample checkouts, job tracking, and quoting.
